# Mark's dotfiles

My dotfiles are stored in a [bare Git repository](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles). I used to store and manage my dotfiles using a non-bare repository and symlinks, but recently changed to a Git bare repository because it was a simpler and easier to maintain and share. If you want to see the benefits of using a Git bare repository for storing dotfiles, watch this excellent [YouTube video by Derek Taylor](https://youtu.be/tBoLDpTWVOM).
